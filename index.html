			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p> My name is Sebastian Keil and I am a student of Artificial Intelligence (MSc) and Finance and Technology (MSc)  at the VU Amsterdam. I have a particular interest in the intersections of AI and psychology, as well as AI and finance. I originally became interested in AI through my investigation of philosophical questions, for instance on the nature of consciousness and intelligence. Later I moved on to dive deeper into programming and the mathematical/algorithmic structures underpinning key AI techniques. I realized that my passion lies in this field and decided to pursue it as my career. </p>

			<p><strong>My goals.</strong> I have always dreamed about making the world a better place, and I believe that AI technology has the potential to elevate the life quality for peple from all around the world. For instance, AI in education could empower those who do not have access to higher education by providing them access to teaching and mentoring through a virtual classroom environment. AI could also enable us to partly recreate the great minds of history and consult them for their advise. In psychotherapie, AI could give patients access to a personal consultation with a simulation of Carl Jung or Carl Rogers. In finance, AI could greatly democratize the financial institutions that to most people seem to operate in the shade. I realize that a lot of hard work is required to turn these ideas into reality. However, taking it one step at a time, I believe that things can be achieved that lie even beyond the imagination. To this end, I value diligance and persistence, hoping that I may take part in the making of a brighter tomorrow. </p>

			<p><strong>Hobbies.</strong> Next to a lot of coding and studying, I also invest some time into learning languages and doing sports. Next to German, English and Dutch, I speak and write some Mandarin. To let some steam off from all the studying, I like to do kickboxing and MMA. As I currently live next to the beach in Scheveningen, I also like to take every chance I get to paddle out for a surf. </p>

			<h2>SECURITY VALUATOR [Personal Project]</h2>
		    <p> <strong>Languages/packages used: </strong> Python, Django, Pandas, ScraPy </p>
		    <p> <strong>GitHub: </strong>  <a href="https://github.com/sebkeil/SecurityValuator" target="_blank">https://github.com/sebkeil/SecurityValuator</a></p>
		    <p> <strong>Why this project? </strong> With this project I aimed to apply my knowledge of Python to a create a tool that I could use myself when looking for stocks to invest in. The tool is based on a common financial evalution method called 'Discounted Cash Flow Method', which basically aims to find to the intrinsic value of a stock by analyzing and projecting Free Cash Flows and other relevant financial data. The website consists of several sub-tools. First, it includeswebscraper that fetches relevant data from YahooFinance (written in Scrapy) and displays it as pandas dataframes. Second, it has a web-based calculator for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which is a metric to the DCF methodology. Third, the DCF calculator applies a series of projections and calculations to arrive at the fair value of the given company. For those who are interested, the code roughly follows the method outlined in this<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd_emLLzJnk"> video.</a></p>
		    <p> The images below show some impressions on what the website has to offer. Please note that it is currently not running live on a server. </p>

		    <p><strong>What are the next steps?</strong> I personally like to use this tool to assist me in analyzing stocks. The next step is to improve the usability of this tool by integrating the four steps into one (i.e. the user only has to fill in the stock ticker and his basic assumptions and receives a full analysis). To complement the output, graphs will be added. After this is achieved, a login-system needs to be implemented so that users may collect their analyzed securities in a personalized portfolio.</p>

			<h2>ESTIMATING AIRBNB PRICES IN AMSTERDAM [University Group Project]</h2>
		    <p> <strong>Languages/packages used: </strong> Python, ScikitLearn, Pandas, TensorFlow </p>

		    <p> <strong>Report: </strong> Click <a href="https://github.com/sebkeil/Group20-VU/blob/master/Estimating%20AirBnb%20Prices%20in%20Amsterdam.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:yellow;"> HERE </a></p>
		    <p> <strong>About this project. </strong> In this machine learning project we experimented with a variety of different ML algorithms in the attempt to accurately predict AirBnb prices in Amsterdam. We also used a variety of methods to optimize hyperparameters, namely Grid Search CV, Randomized CV and Evolutionary Search. The main result of this investigation was that ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor and Random Forest Regressor outperformed other ML methods. </p>
		    <p> <strong>My role in this project. </strong> As I was eager to learn how to implement key ML methods in practice, I took the initiative in doing the programming for this project. This strongly improved my ability to do data science with Python and libraries like ScikitLearn, pandas, TensorFlow and TPOT. I also helped my collegues to do research by engaging the existing literature on regression problems.</p>

			<h2>MASTERING THE GAME OF SCHNAPSEN WITH ENSEMBLE VOTING [University Group Project]</h2>
		    <p> <strong>Languages/packages used: </strong> Python, ScikitLearn, R </p>
		    <p> <strong>Report (incl. Code): </strong> Click <a href="https://github.com/sebkeil/sebkeil.github.io/blob/master/Mastering%20the%20Game%20of%20Schnapsen%20with%20Ensemble%20Voting.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:yellow;"> HERE </a></p>
		    <p> <strong>About this project. </strong> The task was to build an intelligent system that could succeed in the game of Schnapsen against a series of benchmark agents. Our team designed a number of bots and had them compete with the benchmark models. We observed that ML-based bots seemed to perform best, with our ensemble bot consistently outperforming all the other agents. </p>
		    <p> <strong>My role in this project. </strong> I helped in the design of the bots and was in charge of conducting the statistical analysis, using the statistical package R. I also engaged with the existing academic literature on agent design. This project taught me a lot on how to approach the complex task of designing, engineering and testing intelligent agents.</p>
			<p> The images below show the results from our investigation. The ensemble bot is represented on the top rows of the tables. </p>
