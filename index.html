			<h2>FRACTAL TRADING GROUP [Personal Group Project]</h2>
		    <p> <strong>Languages/packages used: </strong> Python, Interactive Brokers API, Pandas, NumPy, ScraPy,  </p>
		    <p> With a group of 4 people, we discussed ideas and implemented prototypes of an advisory investment dashboard. We experimented with different techniques and insights from machine learning, time-series analysis, NLP and fractal geometry. We also discussed with potential investors how this project can benefit them in their daily work. While we were not able to put our work into production, due to time limitations for each of us, it was a great learning experience. </p>

			<h2>SECURITY VALUATOR [Personal Project]</h2>
		    <p> <strong>Languages/packages used: </strong> Python, Django, Pandas, ScraPy </p>
		    <p> <strong>GitHub: </strong>  <a href="https://github.com/sebkeil/SecurityValuator" target="_blank">https://github.com/sebkeil/SecurityValuator</a></p>
		    <p> <strong>Why this project? </strong> With this project I aimed to apply my knowledge of Python to a create a tool that I could use myself when looking for stocks to invest in. The tool is based on a common financial evalution method called 'Discounted Cash Flow Method', which basically aims to find to the intrinsic value of a stock by analyzing and projecting Free Cash Flows and other relevant financial data. The website consists of several sub-tools. First, it includeswebscraper that fetches relevant data from YahooFinance (written in Scrapy) and displays it as pandas dataframes. Second, it has a web-based calculator for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which is a metric to the DCF methodology. Third, the DCF calculator applies a series of projections and calculations to arrive at the fair value of the given company. For those who are interested, the code roughly follows the method outlined in this<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd_emLLzJnk"> video.</a></p>

			<h2>DEEP LEARNING PROJECTS [University Individual Projects]</h2>
			<p> <strong>Languages/packages used: </strong> Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib </p>
			<p> During the course 'Deep Learning' at the VU Amsterdam, we had to complete a challenging assignment each week that is worth mentioning here. The assignments, in conjunction with the lecture part of the course, gave me a deep intuition into the workings of neural networks and equipped me with the skills to apply those practice. These were some of the topics that were covered in the assignments:<br><br>

			<strong> Week 1: </strong> Implement two neural networks (MLPs) from scratch, one using pure python and using NumPy. We had to compute relevant derivatives by hand and the main challenge laid in applying tensor operations and backpropagation using simple looping structures. After implementation, the MLPs had to be trained and tested in a experimental context, using synthetic data as well as the MNIST dataset. <br><br>

			<strong> Week 2:</strong>  Implement an autodiff engine, inspect an advanced autodiff engine and get familiar with PyTorch. We had to automate the process of computing derivatives and backpropagation, as well as understand the computation graph of neural networks. This provided deep insights on the underlying working of popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch. <br><br>

			<strong> Week 3:</strong>  Implement Convolutional Neural Netoworks (CNNs) in PyTorch. We had work with a variety of CNN architectures and inspect their performance in an experimental setting, using tasks related to image classification. <br><br>

			<strong> Week 4:</strong>  Implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in PyTorch. We experimented with a number of different models, including Elman RNNs and LSTMs, which were applied to solve sequential tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis). <br><br>

			<strong> Week 5:</strong> Implement Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) in PyTorch. We learned on and reconstructed the MNIST dataset, and the experimented with changing the latent space (for VAE) and employ different convolutional architectures (for GAN).  <br> </p>

			<h2>COMPUTER VISION PROJECTS [University Group Projects]</h2>
			<p> <strong>Languages/packages used: </strong> Python, Open CV, NumPy, Matplotlib </p>
			<p> <strong>GitHub: </strong>  <a href="https://github.com/sebkeil/ComputerVision-Group" target="_blank" style="color:yellow;">https://github.com/sebkeil/ComputerVision-Group</a></p>
			<p> As I took the course 'Computer Vision 1' at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), we had to complete a complex programming assignment each week, teaching us how to apply a variety of CV algorithms in Python, using libraries like NumPy and OpenCV. Here is a quick overview of what each of these assignments related to: <br><br>

			<strong> Lab 1: </strong> Photometric Stereo & Colour. We had to implement the photometric stereo algorithm, calculate Albedo and Suface Normals and reconstruct images on a 3D surface. There were also tasks related to colour spaces, intrinsic image decomposition and colour constancy. <br><br>

			<strong> Lab 2:</strong> Neighbor Processing & Filters. We implemented low-level filters like Gaussian and Gabor filters. Applied denoising algorithms, for instance using neighborhood processing. Also implemented first- and second-order filters for edge detection and foreground-background seperation. <br><br>

			<strong> Lab 3:</strong> Harris Corner Detector & Optical Flow. We implemented the Harris Corner detection algorithm, which detects points of interest in an image. Then, we implemented the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm, allowing us to track how the HCs change over sequences of images. Finally, we implemented the feature tracking algorithm. <br><br>

			<strong> Lab 4:</strong>  Image Alignment and Stitching. We combined the insights of previous assignments and used RANSAC to estimate the best transformation between images. We then stitched two images together, using the aforementioned algorithms. <br><br>

			<strong> Lab 5:</strong> Part 1: Image Classification using Bag-of-words. We used SIFT descriptors to build a visual vocabulary, which we then utilized in an image classification schema on CIFAR-10. Part 2: CNNs for Image Classification. Similar task to Part 1, but now we trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify CIFAR-10 images. <br> </p>

		    <p> <strong>About this project. </strong> In this machine learning project we experimented with a variety of different ML algorithms in the attempt to accurately predict AirBnb prices in Amsterdam. We also used a variety of methods to optimize hyperparameters, namely Grid Search CV, Randomized CV and Evolutionary Search. The main result of this investigation was that ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor and Random Forest Regressor outperformed other ML methods. </p>
		    <p> <strong>My role in this project. </strong> As I was eager to learn how to implement key ML methods in practice, I took the initiative in doing the programming for this project. This strongly improved my ability to do data science with Python and libraries like ScikitLearn, pandas, TensorFlow and TPOT. I also helped my collegues to do research by engaging the existing literature on regression problems.</p>
